# Scheme PMDAS Parser
- Authors: Vasu Rabadiya, Yug Patel
- Scheme PMDAS(Parenthesis Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction) Parser
- Final Project for Structure of Programming Languages Fall 2024 with Dr. Greg Delozier

## What we did
- Learn Scheme basics in a couple of hours.
- Follow the tokenizing, parsing, and evaluation process as discussed in class.
- Recursion Descent Parsing can be observed between the methods parse_simple_expression(), parse_term() and parse_arithmetic_expression()
- Current program status: almost finished but the program is stuck at an error we suspect is arising from using irrgex
- Both Yug and Vasu, wrote the code together taking alternative turns to pair program.
- We have succeeded because we want to genuinely adopt the functional programming discipline in the future and see where that takes our programming journey instead of trying to mimic non-functional Python interpreter logic discussed in class.

## Future Improvements
- Follow functional programming principles better by limiting local variable assignments
- Debug irrgex error to work with floats and multiple digit numbers.
